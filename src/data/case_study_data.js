After seeing the information architecture and page layout, we decided on a custom Wordpress theme suited our needs.\nI also took the liberty to set technical expectations. One, since the site is evergreen, it should be easily extensible by future developers. And two, that since it's the face of our company, front-end performance should be a priority.\nThe end result is an architected, organizned, modular, testable -- and even commented -- code base. \"View source\", I'm not scared. Always have pride in your code."
